= Todo Flutter Firebase

TodoMore meets Flutter and Firebase

Here we use the term Context in place of Category, as per todofile.txt and 
David Allen's book _Getting Things Done_.

Note: The repo name was changed to todo_flutter_firebase so Flutter api doesn't get angry about the name.

As usual, not interoperable with other ToDoMore modules. 
Thinking about a migration path for ya, for later.

If you want to actually use this code, you will have to create a
Firebase project on the Firebase console and use that to initialize
this project - that will create the file _firebase_options.dart_ that
is missing from the repo (since it is tied to my private Google
account).

== ToDo on the Todo

* the Delete function doesn't have Undo
* import fails with permission. Export not written
* Settings page is a placeholder.
* Hard-coded list of Contexts for now.
