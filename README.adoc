= Todo Flutter Firebase

TodoMore meets Flutter and Firebase

Note: check out as todo_flutter_firebase so flutter api doesn't get angry about the name.

As usual, not interoperable with other ToDoMore modules. 
Thinking about a migration path for ya, for later.

You have to create a Firebase project on the Firebase console and use that to initialize this project - that will create the one file that is missing from the repo (since it is tied to my private Google account).

== ToDo on the Todo

* the Delete function doesn't have Undo
* No TodoText import/export
* Hard-coded list of Contexts
