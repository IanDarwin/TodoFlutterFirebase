= Todo Flutter Firebase

TodoMore meets Flutter and Firebase

Note: check out as todo_flutter_firebase so flutter api doesn't get angry about the name.

As usual, not interoperable with other ToDoMore modules. 
Thinking about a migration path for ya, for later.

You have to create a Firebase project on the Firebase console and use that to initialize this project - that will create the one file that is missing from the repo (since it is tied to my private Google account).

*Incomplete* - lacks the "Add" function, and the edit/copy/delete icons on the list view aren't active yet. Really just wanted to see if I could get Firebase to download and display some data in one evening.
